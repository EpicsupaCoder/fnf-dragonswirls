:dad:Huh? What is a child doing here?
:bf:I don't know, I was sitting in my bean bag chair, and then I was here!
:dad:...How old are you?
:bf:Eight years old!
:dad:...
:bf:While I'm here, want to have a sing battle?
:dad: You shouldn't...
:dad:...
:dad:I guess a bit of singing won't hurt.
:bf:Yay!
